# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning (SQL Project)
##Project Objective

The objective of this project is to clean and transform the Nashville Housing dataset using SQL.
The cleaning process ensures the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis by:

Standardizing date formats

Handling missing property addresses

Splitting composite fields (address, city, state)

Normalizing categorical values

Removing duplicates

Dropping unnecessary columns

##Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from Nashville Housing Data.

##Questions (KPIs)

This project was designed to address the following key data quality issues:

Are all SaleDate entries in a consistent format?

How can missing PropertyAddress values be recovered?

Can property and owner addresses be split into structured fields?

Are categorical fields like SoldAsVacant standardized?

Are there duplicate property records, and how can they be removed?

Which columns are unnecessary for analysis and can be dropped?

##Process

Data Inspection: Queried the raw dataset to identify inconsistencies and missing values

Date Standardization: Converted SaleDate into a proper DATE format

Address Cleaning: Filled missing addresses using ParcelID and split fields into Street, City, and State

Value Normalization: Standardized SoldAsVacant values from Y/N → Yes/No

Duplicate Removal: Used ROW_NUMBER() with PARTITION BY to detect and delete duplicates

Column Cleanup: Dropped redundant columns (OwnerAddress, PropertyAddress, TaxDistrict, etc.)

##Project Insights

Dates are now in a consistent and queryable format

Missing property addresses were successfully recovered from matching ParcelIDs

Property and Owner addresses are now split into structured fields (Street, City, State)

Categorical fields are standardized for easier reporting

Duplicate property records were identified and removed

Final dataset is simplified and analysis-ready

##Final Conclusion

The Nashville Housing SQL project demonstrates practical data cleaning and transformation techniques.
It equips analysts with a structured dataset that is:

Ready for visualization in Power BI, Tableau, or Python

Reliable for further real estate trend analysis

Cleaned using efficient SQL functions and best practices

##Tools & Technologies
